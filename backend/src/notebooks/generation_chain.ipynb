       "'A few years ago, I was standing behind a checkout counter, scanning groceries and chatting with customers. It was a good job, but deep down, I felt a pull toward something more. \\n\\nTransitioning from a supermarket sales associate to a software engineer wasn’t a straight path. It was filled with late nights, online courses, and moments of self-doubt. I remember the first time I tried to code a simple program. It felt like trying to learn a new language while running a marathon. \\n\\nBut every challenge taught me something valuable. I learned to break down complex problems into manageable parts—skills I honed while helping customers find the right products. That same problem-solving mindset became my greatest asset in tech. \\n\\nThere were pivotal moments, too. Like the time I built my first app. The sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. It fueled my passion and made all those late nights worth it. \\n\\nPerseverance and continuous learning became my mantra. I realized that every setback was just a stepping stone. The work ethic I developed in retail—showing up, being reliable, and putting in the effort—translated seamlessly into my new career. \\n\\nIf you’re considering a career change, know that it’s possible. Embrace the learning process, and don’t shy away from the challenges. Your past experiences can shape your future in ways you might not expect. \\n\\nSometimes, the most unexpected journeys lead to the most fulfilling destinations.'"
